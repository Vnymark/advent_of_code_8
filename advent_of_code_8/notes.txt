I need to subtract the parts of the license file that isn't meta data.
Or
I need to subtract the metadata in the license file and add to a variable.
To calculate the sum of the metadata entries.



Maybe I can have two lists of all the numbers.
I can count childs, and metadata.
I add children to a list of childrens and metadata count to a count of metadata.
If child is > 0 I add the read the next two numbers as a header.
For every first number in the header, I add it to the childList.
For every second number in the header, I add to a counter of metadataList.

I need to remove the number from the list as soon as it is used.
And I need to be able to handle the different list and their functions without regard of the other.

So, a list with each number and a int with the sum of MetaData.
